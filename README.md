 A visual understanding mechanism for special environment
 Common image classification and recognition models classify the objects included in an image depending on the saliency while suppressing the background. In contrast, we found that the subjective perception of water background plays an important role in the understanding of underwater images. 
 We use the concept module of multi-scale and large convolution kernel to extract image features. In addition, we construct an attention mechanism that can pay attention to the background features of the image. We propose a new Inception-attention network, and name it as uwnet. In the task of more than 4000 underwater images and more than 5000 non underwater images, uwnet achieved 99.3% accuracy.
